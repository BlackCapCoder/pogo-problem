# N-SeqPiñata'

This is a more restrictive version of [N-SeqPiñata](N-SeqPiñata.md), and the [Piñata](Piñata.md) dual to [N-SeqPogo'](N-SeqPogo'.md). Like [N-SeqPiñata](N-SeqPiñata.md) it sequentially chooses jump lengths `L` and drop points `P` from a list of length `N`, but it has to land on a candy after the last jump in the sequence.
