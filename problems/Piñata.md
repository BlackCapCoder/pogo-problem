# The Pi単ata Problem

    You are riding a pi単ata on the surface of a circle of some integer circumference (C).
    The pi単ata only jumps, and it only jumps some integer length (L).
    At every jump, the pi単ata drops a single candy at some point (P) during the jump. (0 <= P < L)
    If a candy lands on another candy they annihilate each other and emit a photon.
    Will you ever land on a candy, and if so, how many jumps (H) will it take?

* `(C=10, L=2, P=1)` diverges.
* `(C=10, L=7, P=3, H=9)`
* I have checked all problems `0 <= P < L < C < 100`, and there are no solutions where `H > C`. I strongly believe this to be true for all problems.

This is a good time to mention BoolFuck, which is a language that is exactly like BrainFuck, except that it uses bits for memory rather than bytes. This fits better with my candy model. BrainFuck can be directly translated to BoolFuck like this:

| BrainFuck | BoolFuck                                                  |
|-----------|-----------------------------------------------------------|
| `+`       | `>[>]!<[!<]>>>>>>>>>[!]<<<<<<<<<`                         |
| `-`       | `>>>>>>>>>!<<<<<<<<![>!]<[<]>>>>>>>>>[!]<<<<<<<<<`        |
| `<`       | `<<<<<<<<<`                                               |
| `>`       | `>>>>>>>>>`                                               |
| `[`       | `>>>>>>>>>!<<<<<<<<![>!]<[<]>>>>>>>>>[!<<<<<<<<[>]!<[!<]` |
| `]`       | `>>>>>>>>>!<<<<<<<<![>!]<[<]>>>>>>>>>]<[!<]`              |
